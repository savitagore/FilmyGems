                        through the Service (such as user feedback, messages and search queries), and may collect
                        personal information in content you upload to the Service (such as photos or videos you upload
                        and the metadata about your content). We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide
                        the features and functionality of the Service, to correspond with you, and to address any issues
                        you raise about our services. You must not upload photos or other content containing any
                        personal data of third parties without their express consent.</p>

                        If you don’t provide your information to us, you may not be able to access or use certain
                        features of the Service or your experience of using the Service may not be as enjoyable.

                    <h6 class="fw-bold">Information we receive from third parties</h6>
                    <p class="pt-3">
                        We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, when you log into the
                        Service using a third-party account (such as Facebook) we may also collect certain information
                        from the third-party necessary to authenticate your account, such as your email address and any
                        other information you allow the third party to share with us. You should always review, and if
                        necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or
                        connecting them to our Service. You may also unlink your third-party account from our websites
                        by adjusting your settings on the third-party service. If you unlink your third-party account,
                        we will no longer receive information collected about you in connection with that service.

                    <h6 class="fw-bold">Information we collect from you automatically</h6>
                    <p class="pt-3">We will directly collect or generate certain information about your use of the
                        Service (such as user activity data, analytics event data and clickstream data), for data
                        analytics and machine learning, and to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.
                        We may also use third party analytics tools that automatically collect information sent by your
                        browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in
                        improving the Service. For more information, please see the paragraphs below on cookies
                        information, log file information, clear gifs, device identifiers, and location data.
                        Cookies information and information taken from similar technologies
                        When you visit the Service, we (and our third-party partners) will send cookies — small text
                        files containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies
                        your browser and lets us do things like help you log in faster, enhance your navigation through
                        the site, remember your preferences and generally improve the user experience. Cookies also
                        convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you
                        click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track
                        your usage of the Service over time. They also allow us to measure traffic and usage trends for
                        the Service, deliver personalized advertisements that may be of interest to you and measure
                        their effectiveness, and find potential new users of the Service.
                        You can control or reset your cookies and similar technologies through your web browser, which
                        will allow you to customize your cookie preferences and to refuse all cookies or to indicate
                        when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if
                        the ability to accept cookies is disabled. For more information on how we use cookies and other
                        technologies and how you can control them, please read our <u>Cookies Policy</u>.
                        Log file information</p>
                    <p class="pt-3">Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each
                        time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain
                        log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web
                        request, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact
                        with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
                        information.
                        Clear gifs/web beacons information
                    </p>
                    <p class="pt-3">When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which
                        are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also
                        use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which
                        links are clicked by recipients. This information allows for more accurate reporting and
                        improvement of the Service.

                    <h6 class="fw-bold">Device identifiers</h6>
                    <p class="pt-3">
                        When you access the Service on a device (including smart-phones or tablets), we may access,
                        collect and/or monitor one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier
                        (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files that uniquely identify your mobile device. A
                        device identifier may convey information to us about how you use the Service. A device
                        identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in and navigate the Service
                        better. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use of device identifiers is
                        impaired.
